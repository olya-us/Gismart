    <p>
        1. We will not transfer your personal data outside of the EU, except as set
        out in paragraph 6 above, for example if we utilise cloud-based platforms
        to store personal data, which may involve use of geographically distributed
        data centres.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. In the case of these extra-EU transfers, where the transfers are not to
        countries that provide an adequate level of protection, we will put in
        place appropriate safeguards to cover transfers of personal data including,
        for example, signing standard contractual clauses, relying on a Privacy
        Shield certification and/or data protection clauses adopted by the European
        Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. If there are any other circumstances which would require us to transfer
        personal data outside of the UK, we will seek your consent to transfer your
        personal data outside of the UK.
    </p>

        VII. <strong>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Platform may contain links to third party websites. If you follow a
        link to a third-party website, please note that this Privacy Policy does
        not apply to those websites. We are not responsible or liable for the
        privacy policies or practices of those websites, so please check their
        policies before you submit any personal data to those websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        VIII. <strong>SECURITY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        1. We take data security seriously. We implement and maintain appropriate
        technical and organisational measures including resilient security systems
        and protocols to protect the personal data we store.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. We have put procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security
        breach and will notify you and applicable regulator of a suspected breach
        where the breach may cause a risk to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
        identity before we are able to disclose personal data to you.
    </p>
    <p>
